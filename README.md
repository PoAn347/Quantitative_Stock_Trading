This script aims to address these needs by providing a versatile and customizable solution for stock analysis and trading strategy implementation.

Key Features:

Data Retrieval and Visualization:

The script leverages the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch historical stock data for analysis.
It includes functions to visualize stock data using candlestick charts, aiding in the interpretation of price trends and patterns.

Data Analysis:

Using the Pandas library, the script performs in-depth data analysis, calculating statistical metrics such as price volatility, daily returns, and annualized return volatility.
Traders can gain valuable insights into market dynamics and make informed decisions based on data-driven analysis.
Monte Carlo Simulation:

The script implements both simple Monte Carlo simulation and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) simulation techniques to project future stock price movements.
Traders can simulate various scenarios to assess risk and evaluate the potential outcomes of their trading strategies.
Grid Trading Strategy:

A robust grid trading strategy is defined within the script using the GridTradeStrategy class.
Traders can automate their trading decisions based on predefined parameters such as lower bound, upper bound, and the number of grid lines.
The strategy dynamically adjusts positions based on price movements across grid lines, allowing traders to capitalize on market fluctuations.
Grid Optimization:

The script includes a GridOptimization class to optimize grid trading strategy parameters based on historical data.
Traders can use brute-force optimization to iterate over parameter combinations and evaluate profitability, enhancing the effectiveness of their trading strategies.

Usage:

Example:

In the folder "View in Jupyter Notebook," we illustrate the application of financial data analysis techniques using the latest three-month NVIDIA stock price as an example. The demonstration showcases how these techniques can assess stock performance and simulate future outcomes. Here's a breakdown of the process:

Calculating Return Rate and Volatility:
We begin by utilizing the 'stock_return&volatility' file to compute the return rate and volatility of the stock under consideration.

Monte Carlo Simulation for Price Prediction:
Next, we employ Monte Carlo Simulation techniques to predict future stock prices. By adjusting parameters such as return rate and volatility, we simulate the stock price and determine its range. The bottom and top bounds represent the 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively.

Gridline Performance Evaluation:
We further refine the simulation by determining the optimal number of gridlines between the top and bottom bounds. Running the simulation enables us to effectively evaluate its performance.

For this project, we utilize NVIDIA's stock data from the last three months of 2023 and test it against data from 2024, starting from January 1st. Notably, the observed return rate stands at 28%. Although this figure is lower than that of a buy-and-hold strategy, the grid trading strategy is deemed less risky, resulting in relatively higher Sharpe ratios.

Through exploring these methodologies, our aim is to provide insights into potential trading strategies and risk management approaches in the dynamic world of financial markets.
